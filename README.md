# Saoirse Launcher [OUTDATED]

_This repository contains the original libogc-based project that preceeded the development of [Starling](https://github.com/mkwcat/starling). Please see that repository for the modern rewrite of the project._

_The orignal readme read as followed:_

Saoirse is a (WIP) portable Wii homebrew project for launching games under a modified IOS firmware. The project aims to eventually become a user-friendly launcher for game modifications.

## Planned Features

Without any requirement for installation or modification to the Wii console itself, Saoirse hopes to provide the following:

* Game file replacement.
* Save data redirection.
* Support for patch configuration and module formats (such as [Riivolution](https://github.com/AerialX/rawksd), [Brainslug](https://github.com/Chadderz121/brainslug-wii)).
* Game backup loading.
